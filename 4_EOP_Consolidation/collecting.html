          </p>

          <p>
            My favorite thing about Loyola is its commitment to environmental sustainability; Loyola makes their own hand soap and uses it throughout the school.

          <p>
            Loyola’s emphasis on providing education that emphasizes knowledge and global perspectives. Loyola not only places high value on teaching students about the issues in our world but allows them to do hands on work in our communities to remedy these issues, which is extremely valuable.

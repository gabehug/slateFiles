# Code Snippets and workspace for LUC Web Designer Position
This is the repository that I am using to develop and store project code for my position at Loyola University Chicago. </br>
*Projects will only make it here if they are code intensive.* The structure of this repo **will change over time!**

## 1. CSS Consolidation Project

I am currently working to consolidate 7 different CSS sheets that are styling the GPEM website. These files were provided by an external vendor and there are thousands of lines of unused code that I am removing. 

### Project Goals
- Reduce load time 
- Reduce amount of code sent to website 
- Send as few CSS sheets as possible to the site

## 2. HTML 

The HTML folder holds a rough HTML outline of the main GPEM homepage

## 3. FAQ Creation

This is the code for the new FAQ section being added to the GPEM Website with Frequently Asked Questions for students.

## 4. EOP Consolidation 

Code for the consolidation of Enrollment Advisor appointment portals to the main GPEM Appointment Portals.

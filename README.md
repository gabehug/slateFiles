# Code Snippets and workspace for LUC Web Designer Position
This is the repository that I am using to develop and store project code for my position at Loyola University Chicago. *Projects will only make it here if they are code intensive.* 
The structure of this repo **will change over time!**

## 1. CSS Consolidation Project

I am currently working to consolidate 7 different CSS sheets that are styling the GPEM website. These files were provided by an external vendor and there are thousands of lines of unused code that I am removing. 

### Project Goals
- Reduce load time 
- Reduce amount of code sent to website 
- Send as few CSS sheets as possible to the site

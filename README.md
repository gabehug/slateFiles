# Code Snippets and workspace for LUC Web Designer Position
This is the repository that I am using to develop and store project code for my position as the Web Developer at Loyola University Chicago. </br>
*Projects will only make it here if they are code intensive.*

## 1. CSS Consolidation Project

The goal of this project is to consolidate the existing 7 style sheets down to a single sheet for the GPEM Website. This is being done to reduce the load times for the GPEM webpages in 2 ways: 

  a. Reducing the amount of code being sent client side every time the page is loaded  
  b. Eliminating cumulative layout shift from overriding styles multiple times  

## 2. HTML 

The HTML folder holds a rough HTML outline of the main GPEM homepage

## 3. FAQ Creation

This is the code for the new FAQ section being added to the GPEM Website with Frequently Asked Questions for students.

## 4. EOP Consolidation 

Code for the consolidation of Enrollment Advisor appointment portals to the main GPEM Appointment Portals. 

## 5. Build Updates

This folder holds the Original Build Files before brand updates were made and the files with the new brand updates/style updates applied. The changes are largely to update brand colors being used for all portals/events/forms using the Default Branding (which is what the build files are used for) but also include a new header with dropdowns to better match the website_headernav content block being used for other portals.
